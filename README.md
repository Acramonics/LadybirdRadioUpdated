The Ladybird book *Making a Transistor Radio* by G.C. Dobbs with
wonderful illustrations by B.H. Robinson was first published in 1972
and reissued as a facsimile in 2008. The book goes through the
construction of the radio in stages, starting with a crystal set,
adding a single transistor amplifier, followed by a second transistor
amplifier. Finally, the radio frequency stage is improved through
'regeneration' using a third transistor to improve sensitivity.

Back around 1974, aged 10, I made this radio and it worked well for
me. It seems that others didn't have as much luck, particularly with
the final stage which was susceptible to oscillation - I suspect this
was a result of variation between samples of the transistors.  The
transistors used were PNP germanium types and are now very difficult
to obtain as they are no longer produced.  When you can find them,
they are very expensive as they are popular for guitar effects pedals.

As a result of these problems, @AndyDoz on YouTube has modified the
design to use easily-obtained silicon NPN transistors requiring the
power rails to be swapped over. Other small changes have been
introduced to reduce the chance of oscillation, adding a separate coil
for the regeneration stage and introducing emitter resistors as well
as modifying the transistor biasing to suit the silicon transistors. 

He has tried to replicate the original design as much as possible
including the use of a wooden board and brass screws with screwcups to
connect the components. Doz is providing a series of videos on YouTube
documenting the project.

My project takes Doz's design and ports it to a PCB. The first stage
will be a PCB for the full radio with regeneration. I will then modify
the PCB to allow each stage (crystal set, one-transistor and
two-transistor amplifiers) to be built on the same PCB.
